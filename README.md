# Module_7_Topic_4_File_IO_using_Tuples_Assignment
In this assignment you will tie together the seemingly unrelated tuple and arbitrary argument list to perform file input and output.  Your program will take a student's name and an unknown number of test scores, store them in a tuple, save that tuple into a file, and then finally print the data from the file back to the screen.
